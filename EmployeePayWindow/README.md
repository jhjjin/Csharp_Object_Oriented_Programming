# EmployeePayWindow â€” C# (.NET Framework 4.7.2, Windows Forms)
```
A simple Windows Forms app that computes an employeeâ€™s net take-home commission from weekly sales.
The app applies a 7% commission to the entered sales and then deducts federal tax (18%), retirement (15%), and social security (9%) from the commission to display the net pay.
