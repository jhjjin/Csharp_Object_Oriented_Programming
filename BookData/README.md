# ðŸ“š BookData â€” Inheritance & Composition in C#

A small C# console project that models **reading materials** using OOP.  
It demonstrates **inheritance**, **encapsulation**, **method overriding (custom ToString)**, and **composition** (`Book` has a `Date`).

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
BookData/
â”œâ”€â”€ Program.cs             # Demo app (creates a Book and a Magazine)  
â”œâ”€â”€ ReadingMaterial.cs     # Base class with Title & Price  
â”œâ”€â”€ Book.cs                # Derived class (adds Author, PublicationDate)  
â”œâ”€â”€ Date.cs                # Simple date value object (Month/Day/Year)  
â””â”€â”€ Magazine.cs            # Derived class (adds EditorInChief)

---

## ðŸ§  What it Shows
- **Inheritance:** `Book` and `Magazine` inherit from `ReadingMaterial`.
- **Composition:** `Book` contains a `Date` object for publication date.
- **Encapsulation:** All fields are private with public properties.
- **Polymorphism hook:** `ReadingMaterial` defines a `virtual ToString()` method that derived types can override.

> Note: In this codebase `ToString()` is declared as `virtual void ToString()`.  
> Thatâ€™s fine for the demo, but idiomatic C# overrides `public override string ToString()` from `object`.  
> See the _Improvements_ section below.
