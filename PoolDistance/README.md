# PoolDistance â€” C# (.NET Framework 4.7.2 Console Application)
```
A console app that models swimming pools with a location and water temperature, then computes pairwise distances between pools and reports the closest one(s).
It demonstrates composition (Pool has a Location and Temperature), static utility methods, and simple numerical computations.

## âœ¨ Features
```
- Location class with X, Y coordinates and input clamping (non-positive values become 0).
- Temperature class with degree + scale (string) and range guard.
- Pool class that aggregates Location and Temperature, plus a static Count of created pools.
- Pool.FindDistance(..) to compute Euclidean distance.
- Utility helpers (Lesser, Lesser2, Lesser3) to pick the minimum of multiple distances.
- Demo in Program.Main that:
    Creates pools at preset coordinates,
    Assigns random temperatures,
    Prints distances and the closest pool(s).

## ðŸ§  Concepts Demonstrated
```
- Object composition and encapsulation
- Static methods and state (Pool.Count)
- Defensive setters (input clamping)
- Simple algorithm design (min selection)
```
