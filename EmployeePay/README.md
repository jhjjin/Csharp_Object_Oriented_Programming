# EmployeePay â€” C# (.NET Framework 4.7.2 Console Application)
```
This project calculates an employeeâ€™s take-home pay based on total sales and several deduction rates.
It demonstrates the use of classes, constants, accessor/mutator methods, and simple business logic encapsulation in C#.

## ðŸ§© Features
```
- Stores employee details:
- employeeNumber, firstName, lastName, and totalSales
- Calculates:
       Commission at 9% of sales
       Federal tax at 18%
       Retirement contribution at 10%
       Social security tax at 6%
       Allows the user to update employee information using mutator methods
       Displays the final take-home pay

## ðŸ’¡ Formula
```
- commission = totalSales * COMMISSION_RATE
- taxBase = totalSales + commission
- federalTax = taxBase * FEDERAL_TAX_RATE
- retirement = taxBase * RETIREMENT_CONTRIBUTION
- socialSecurity = taxBase * SOCIAL_SECURITY_TAX_RATE
- takeHome = taxBase - (federalTax + retirement + socialSecurity)
```

## ðŸ§  Concepts Demonstrated
```

Constants and computation logic
Input validation using TryParse
Accessor and mutator method design
```
