# IntegerPower â€” C# (.NET Framework 4.7.2 Console Application)
```
A simple console program that demonstrates the use of methods, loops, and integer arithmetic to calculate integer powers without using the built-in Math.Pow() function.
The program includes two variations â€” one for direct output and one that stores the result in a variable before displaying.

â”œâ”€â”€ IntegerPower.sln
â”œâ”€â”€ IntegerPower.csproj
â”œâ”€â”€ Program.cs               // Contains IntegerPower() method and main logic

## ðŸ§© Features
```
- Calculates the result of baseNum raised to the power of exponent (e.g., 3^4 = 81)
- Uses a for loop to repeatedly multiply the base number
- Demonstrates the concept of method creation, parameter passing, and return values
- Displays results in a clear, formatted output
```

## ðŸ§  Concepts Demonstrated
```
- For loop iteration for repeated multiplication
- Static methods with return values
- Integer arithmetic without floating-point operations
- Code reusability by separating logic into methods
```
