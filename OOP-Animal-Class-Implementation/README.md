# OOP Animal Class Implementation

A simple C# demonstrating OOP concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation. 
This creates an Animal base class and extends it into Dog and Bird classes.

## Concepts Used
- Inheritance (Animal -> Dog, Bird)
- Method Overriding / Polymorphsim 
- Encapsulation with constructors and properties

## Example Output

  #1: A 2-year-old animal by the name of J
  #2: A 8-year-old animal by the name of Z
  J is moving quickly

  ------Testing Dog class------
  #1: A golden retriever dog:  age: 2,  name H
  #2: A chiwawa dog:  age: 3,  name Y
  The golden retriever of age 2 is running quickly to the hills
  The chiwawa of age 3 is barking loudly
  Between the 2 dogs, the older one is at the age of 3

  ------Testing Bird class------
  #1: A yellow bird:  age: 2,  name L
  #2: A yellow bird:  age: 2,  name K
