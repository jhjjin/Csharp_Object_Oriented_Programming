# StudentAccessorsMutators — C# (.NET Framework 4.7.2 Console Application)
```
This project demonstrates encapsulation in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) using accessor (getter) and mutator (setter) methods within a Student class.
It models students with attributes such as name, ID, and GPA, and includes methods that simulate student actions like studying and paying fees.

## ✨ Features
```
- Defines a Student class with private fields and public methods
- Demonstrates constructor overloading (four versions)
- Implements accessors (GetName(), GetGpa(), GetId())
- Implements mutators (SetName(), SetGpa())
- Includes behavioral methods:
    Study(string major) — prints a study action
    PayFees(double amount) — simulates fee payment
    DisplayInfo() — displays formatted student data
    Showcases data encapsulation, ensuring controlled access to fields

## ⚙️ Key Concepts Demonstrated
```
- Encapsulation — keeping class data private
- Accessors & Mutators — controlling how data is read/modified
- Constructor Overloading — multiple initialization options
- Basic object interactions — calling methods from main program
```
